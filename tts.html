Sessions served in the United States Army Reserve from 1973 to1986 ultimately attaining the rank of Captain. He still considers that period to be one of the most rewarding chapters of his life.\r\nSessions\u2019 interest in the law led to a distinguished legal career, first as a practicing attorney in Russellville, Alabama, and then in Mobile, a place he now calls home. Following a two-year stint as Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama (1975\u20131977), Sessions was nominated by President Reagan in 1981 and confirmed by the Senate to serve as the United States Attorney for Alabama\u2019s Southern District, a position he held for 12 years.

Sessions was selected for the 112th and 113th Congresses to serve as the Ranking Member on the Senate Budget Committee to restrain the growth of federal spending and make permanent tax cuts that benefit American families.

As a result, Medicare payments to Alabama hospitals will increase by nearly $1 billion over a 10-year period. Sessions authored a key provision in the 2001 tax cut bill to make interest earned on tuition savings and prepaid tuition plans tax free. That provision will mean a big financial boost for families of the 50,000 Alabama children enrolled in the affordable Alabama Prepaid College Tuition Plan.\r\nSenator Sessions joined in leading efforts to make funding more equal in the Ryan White CARE Act. The South has been hardest hit with HIV\/AIDS in recent years, but the funding formula kept most of the money going to big cities.

The newly opened tract of land, which is 125 miles off the coast, contains an estimated 1.3 billion barrels of oil and 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The law also included a provision to share tens-of-millions of federal revenue dollars each year with Alabama to fund environmental restoration and coastal infrastructure projects.\r\nWhile serving in the United States Senate, Sessions has received numerous awards including: the American Conservative Union Award for Conservative Excellence; the Reserve Officers Association Minuteman of the Year Award; the National Taxpayers Union Friend of the Taxpayer Award; the Watchdogs of the Treasury Golden Bulldog Award; the National Federation of Independent Business Guardian of Small Business Award; the Coalition of Republican Environment Advocates Teddy Roosevelt Environmental Award; and the Alabama Farmers Federation Service to Agriculture Award.\r\nIn 2014, the people of Alabama overwhelmingly voted to return Sessions to the Senate for a fourth term, electing him with more than 97 percent of all votes cast.\r\nHe keeps close tabs on the concerns of his Alabama constituents, holding town meetings and traveling to all 67 counties in the state each year.\r\nSessions has served as a lay leader and as a Sunday school teacher at his family\u2019s church, Ashland Place United Methodist Church, in Mobile.
